                Take a more strategic approach to compensation with SAP SuccessFactors Compensation & Variable Pay. The solution provides a unique set of capabilities to help you model and manage competitive compensation programs and motivate your workforce.
                At Dabar training, we believe that compensation is a strategic tool for shaping employee behavior and influencing organizational performance. Compensation & variable pay solutions that focus on automation, streamlining and simplifying the compensation process, only increase the speed and efficiency of the current process. Automation alone does not enable strategic compensation processes.
